  <h2> Where I Went </h2>
  <p> Hello! <a href="page1.html"> I went to MacRitchie reservoir</a></p>
  <p>I went there for my Geographical Investigation Project. we managed to see the zig-zag bridge, spillway and other designated features. 
     I also saw a monkey when I first arrived to the MacRitchi Reservoir Park. I also observed aquatic plants and animals in the water, example, fishes and turtles.
     Not only that, I also saw a monkey when I first arrived there. It was a sight to behold as we could usually only see monkeys in the zoo. </p>
  
  <h2> What I did there </h2>
  <p> I reside and operate in the American city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)"> Metropolis </a></p>
  <p>as a journalist for the Daily Planet.</p>
